Grabs live share prices of SPY via Robinhood

Here's a small program I created that scrapes the live share price of SPY from Robinhood, using BeautifulSoup. With pandas it also writes the data to a .csv file for easy viewing, once the data is collected. The period and frequency of retrieval is also customizable, which is super cool. I tried coding this in Java first, which was incredibly hard for me, even though I've been using Python for a significantly shorter time. It's a great language for these quick and fun side projects.
